## Education

|   |   |
|---|---|
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">2008.08 to 2014.05</span> | Doctor of Philosophy, Bioinformatics and Computational Biology |
| | _University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC_ |
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">1996.09 to 2001.06</span> | Bachelor of Science, Computer Science |

## Research Experience

|   |
|---|---|
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">2014.09 to Present</span> | __National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD__ |
|               | _Postdoctoral Fellow, Laboratory of Dr. Francis S Collins_ |
|               | Investigating the role of epigenetics in common complex disese, especially type 2 diabetes. |
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">2009.05 to 2014.08</span> | __University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC__ |
|               | _Research Assistant, Laboratory of Dr. Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena_ |
|               | Characterized the genetic determinants of two meiotic drive systems in the mouse. First, conducted a GWAS of wild mice to identify genes associated with the accumulation of Robertsonian translocations. Second, mapped a novel meiotic drive locus, R2d2, and multiple modifier loci responsible for extreme TRD in the Collaborative Cross. Also developed CLASP, a software tool for validation of cell lines used in research. |
| <span style="white-space:nowrap">2007.08 to 2008.08</span> | __Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA__ |
|               | _Computational Biology Software Engineer, Laboratory of Dr. Ruedi Aebersold_ |
|               | Developed informatics software to support proteomics research. Created TIQAM, a work flow management system for MRM (Multiple Reaction Monitoring) experiments. |
