    dates: 2014.09 to Present
    area: Computational biology, epignentics of common disease
    details:
      - Leveraging a large, multi-`omics dataset to investigate epigenetic mechanisms
        underlying regulatory variants implicated in type 2 diabetes.
      - Developing machine-learning approaches to imputation for multi-`omics data.
      - Designed and currently optimizing a novel sequencing assay for single-molecule 
        resolution transcriptome analysis.
      - Using single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility data to understand
        cell-to-cell variability in pancreatic islets, including responses to glucose perturbation.
      - Developed user-friendly software tools for QC and pre-processing of NGS reads.

    area: Computational biology, mammalian geneitics
    details:
      - Characterized the genetic determinants of two meiotic drive systems in the mouse.
        First, conducted a GWAS of wild mice to identify genes associated with the accumulation
        of Robertsonian translocations. Second, mapped a novel meiotic drive locus, *R2d2*,
        and multiple modifier loci responsible for extreme transmission distortion in the Collaborative Cross.
