research:
  - place: National Human Genome Research Institute
    location: Bethesda, MD
    title: Postdoctoral Fellow
    advisor: Dr. Francis S Collins
    dates: 2014.09 to Present
    area: Computational biology, epignentics of common disease
    details: 
        Investigating the role of epigenetics in common complex disese, especially type 2 diabetes.
  - place: University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
    location: Chapel Hill, NC
    title: Research Assistant
    advisor: Dr. Fernando Pardo-Manuel de Villena
    dates: 2009.05 to 2014.08
    area: Computational biology, mammalian geneitics
    details:
      Characterized the genetic determinants of two meiotic drive systems in the mouse. 
      First, conducted a GWAS of wild mice to identify genes associated with the accumulation 
      of Robertsonian translocations. Second, mapped a novel meiotic drive locus, R2d2, 
      and multiple modifier loci responsible for extreme TRD in the Collaborative Cross. Also 
      developed CLASP, a software tool for validation of cell lines used in research.
